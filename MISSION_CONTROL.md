## 📌 Notes for OpenClaw

- Do not rely on Discord chat history for project context. This file is your memory.
- At the end of every session, update this file, commit it with the message `chore: update mission control state`, and push it to the main branch.
- When in doubt about what to work on next, re-read this file before asking.
- Reference GitHub Issue numbers in this file rather than copying long descriptions here. Keep it lean.
